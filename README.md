# Ola-Data-Analytics

# Ola Data Analyst Project

This project simulates Ola ride booking data, generated using AI (GPT), and demonstrates data analysis using SQL queries.

## Project Overview

- **Data Generation:** The datasets (`Bookings.csv`, `Bookings - mumbai_rides_data.csv`, `Bookings-100000-Rows - July.csv`) were generated using GPT to simulate real-world Ola ride bookings.
- **Analysis:** SQL queries were written and executed for data analysis, but the queries themselves were not stored in the repository.
- **Visualization:** Insights from the data were visualized using Power BI ([ola_dashboard.pbix](ola_dashboard.pbix)).

## Repository Structure

- [`Bookings.csv`](Bookings.csv): AI-generated ride booking datasets.
- [`ola_dashboard.pbix`](ola_dashboard.pbix): Power BI dashboard for data visualization.
- [`ola_queries.sql`](ola_queries.sql): Example SQL scripts used for database setup and sample queries.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Data:** Explore the AI-generated CSV files for simulated booking records.
2. **Database Setup:** Use the example SQL scripts to create and query tables in your SQL environment.
3. **Visualization:** Open the Power BI file to view dashboards and insights.
4. **Documentation:** Refer to the PDF and PPTX files for project details and presentations.
